# Car Guessing Game ðŸš—

This Flutter-based game lets players guess a car model within 10 attempts, using hints and clues to narrow down the options. Each attempt brings the player closer to the answer, creating an engaging guessing game.

## ðŸš™ Key Features

- **Search & Filter**: Use a search bar to filter car models and brands.
- **Hints & Feedback**: Each guess provides color-coded hints, along with directional arrows for numeric values.
- **Win & Game Over States**: The player wins if they guess correctly within 10 tries or loses if all attempts are used up.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `GamePage`: Manages the game interface, search bar, and gameplay logic.
- `GameService`: Handles the loading and initialization of car data.
- `Car`: A data model representing car details, including brand, model, seats, doors, and acceleration.

> **Note**: Currently, `GameService` and `GamePage` need to be reimplemented to use the `Car` model directly.
